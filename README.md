# Development Goals:

As I embarked on this full stack project, my main goal was to create a robust and scalable full-stack app with both client and server-side components and deploy it successfully, work with a React-based framework (few weeks later React deprecate create-react-app) and create an API using Express and Prisma.
At the time I chose Next.js because it had just launched the 13 version with the App Router in the Beta version, something that was changing the game even for developers that worked with Next.js before, so it felt it was a challenge and a good idea to learn a new technology that had just been released.
In terms of my development goals, my primary objective was to implement as many essential features as possible. This included ensuring the application had authentication and security, a user-friendly UI/UX, and clean, maintainable code. I also wanted to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and use them where appropriate to enhance the performance and functionality of the application.
